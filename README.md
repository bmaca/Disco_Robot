This is a weekend project with some HTML5, CSS3 and JQuery.

This is a disco dancing Robot, that will definitely light up the mood of the party. 

Feel free to fork the repo, and add anything youd like to see in it :)

### Instructions to run the robot locally

*  Clone the repo
*  ```cd Disco_Robot```
*   open ```robot.html``` 

Pour some whiskey, turn on some techno and have a wicked strobe light party. :)
